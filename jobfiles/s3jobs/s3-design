need to get the RGW targets
need to configure 2 users.  1 for replica pool, 1 for EC pool
need to get the secret keys
set http_mode = s3
http_host = rgw servers
http_s3_key - secret key
http_s3_keyid - keyid

need to set placement policies for the users
when jobs are run, they need to be as equally distributed among loadgens as possible
queuedepth=1 for s3 jobs, scale with numjobs
    Do cli passed options overwrite jobfile options?
